This is NOT a 'clean' Debian package, as it is not using the proper Javahelper
tooling (https://wiki.debian.org/Java/Packaging#Gradle). It also requires an
external run of the configure command.

To build the package, you must run:

$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -b -uc -us
